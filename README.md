# VS Code Brownie Container

A containerized environment for developing blockchain applications using
Solidity, Python 3, and Brownie in Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. This enables
you to create an isolated, reproducible development environment for building and
testing your apps. To use it, you'll need [Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and the [Remote -
Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
plugin for VS Code.

This is intended as a starting point, and doesn't have a lot of extra plugins or
tools. To learn how to customize it for your needs, read Microsoft's [Remote
development in
Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial)
documentation and the [Dockerfile
reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).
